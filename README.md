# zellij-tab-bar

A tab bar plugin for [Zellij](https://zellij.dev), written in AssemblyScript. This is mostly an experiment to see if it is possible to write a fully functioning plugin to Zellij in AssemblyScript, and should probably not be considered stable in any way.

See https://github.com/bendiksolheim/as-zellij for the framework used.
